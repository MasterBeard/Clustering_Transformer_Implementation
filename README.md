## A Simplified Transformer Clustering Demonstration
![Demonstration of data clustering for transformer embedding reduction](Transformer-kmeans_00.jpg)  
*This diagram illustrates the process of clustering data to reduce the embedding layer size in transformer models. The visualization shows how high-dimensional embeddings can be effectively grouped to create a more compact representation while preserving essential patterns.*
